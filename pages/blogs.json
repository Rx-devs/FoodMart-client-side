Darkleafy greens buttery goat cheese and lusciously creamy balsamic dressing. A) Yes it’s a slice of healthy eating heaven, and B) this is the salad / bowl situation you want gracing the shelves of your fridge this winter.Like, for days. Because you can meal-prep it! THANK YOU GRAIN BOWLS for knowing what we need.Grain bowl in meal prep containers.One of the best things about these wintery grain bowls is that they can stand up to some fridge time. Yes keep the kale goat cheese and pistachios separate to maintain their freshness. But that roasted vegetable, wild rice, and dried cherry medley can sit tight in a little bit of balsamic dressing while it’s in the fridge and kinda just keeps getting better and better.",

    "description": "This is not your ordinary curry chicken salad – it’s a GODDESS CURRY CHICKEN SALAD. Which basically just means I feel like the summer goddess of health and wellness when I eat this. Especially on an everything bagel. So, yes, my definitely of health and wellness goes a little bit outside the box sometimes.This really isn’t all that different from a regular curry chicken salad, except no fruit – none of this apples or grapes or blueberries business – and no mayo. As you have seen from my love of Wild Rice Burgers, I have a healthy love and respect for good old fashioned mayonnaise. But if we’re getting into the summer goddess zone? Goodbye, mayo. Greek yogurt feels like such a basic stand-in, but that’s because it works. It’s good. It is thick, creamy, and the added tang is a welcome addition to this salad, IMHO.Real Chicken Talk: THIS CHICKEN, you guys. I will never make another kind of chicken for salad toss-ins. I cut it in half horizontally, so the pieces were super thin, and then I loaded them with garlic powder, onion powder, curry powder, salt, and pepper. Sautéed in a little olive oil, and MWAH. Best quick chicken ever. I even let it get a little extra browned on the outside because I play by my own rules.",

    "description": "ese Red Chile Chicken Tacos are always on our minds! Lightly pan-fried corn tortillas stuffed with tender chicken and a pinto bean red chile saucy filling piles of creamy corn salsa, and tangy homemade pickled red onions. YUM! JUMP TO RECIPE Chicken tacos on a plate with creamy corn THIS RECIPE It’s been a little bit since we’ve written a love letter to tacos, though they are truly always on our minds. We really will take them in almost any variation but when they’re coming at us in warm, lightly pan-fried yellow corn tortillas bursting with a tender chicken and pinto bean red chile saucy sensation, piles of a quick creamy corn salsa…ish (can we call it salsa when mayo is involved? probably not) and tangy-crisp homemade pickled red onions rounding it out?Well my oh my there’s a new crush in town.There are so many delicious flavors going on with these chicken tacos, but the real highlight is that you don’t have to do very much work to accomplish any of them. The taco filling especially is so easy and pretty darn quick because all you’re doing is cooking up some chicken thighs, tossing in a can of pinto beans, and then opening up a packet of Frontera red chile enchilada sauce (total fave and namesake!) and letting that do all the work.Boom. Bam. Lightly spiced, smoky, tomatoey, saucy goodness ready to stuff your tortillas so full they spill over onto your hands.Then you get to just kind of fancify things. You’ll mix up a little corn situation with some major elote vibes that is also so easy but will be VERY DIFFICULT to hold off on eating until taco assembly. Just a taste to adjust the lime juice? Okay. Twenty more bites and oops it’s gone? It happens. Luckily, it’s easy to remake. You’re going to make some quick pickled red onions because really you’re just throwing some things in a jar, giving it a shake, and then, look at you, all set with the most delicious little taco topper ever! Next thing you know, you have one gem of a taco happening.",

You can throw veg in there Protein? Coming ‘atcha. Cheese? Yes of course, why not.So we wanted to take the feel of that very regular and totally acceptable meal and make it so much more fun. Because here we are in February, the longest shortest month.Light puffy scrambled eggs, speckled with little bits of bacon and spinach or any other veg/protein combo you love, some hashbrowns tossed in for good measure, and extra cheese that gets all goldy-crisp on top.BUT IN WAFFLE FORM. WAFFLES! You can toss them on sandwiches cut them up in strips for dippers or like we love to do pile them to the sky with delicious toppings. Crumbles of goat cheese a swath of nutty sharp romesco sauce a spoonful of peppers and garlic confit avocado for days a sprinkle of chives cuz they cute, maybe hot sauce because why stop now?There are no limits to what you can make happen with these and your waffle maker is so excited to be of service.

There’s salt, there’s pepper, and there’s paprika to season, but hello VERY IMPORTANT there’s also hot crusty bread for dipping. Broccoli cheese soup ingredients in a dutch oven.

No, I mean it.

I walk around obnoxiously saying that I really prefer summer and fall and maybe even the first few days of winter, but spring? not so much.And then spring comes around and the air tastes like flowers and dirt and rain and I don’t have to wear a jacket and we can keep the windows open at night and I remember that, yes indeed! I actually love spring. Or more like I NEED spring. Isn’t it just such a sweet drink for the soul? Is it just me, or does this spring season feel especially life-giving? I feel like as soon as April came around the corner, I just dove headfirst into a few months of all things New and Fresh and Life. Like for example. We have a new studio that we’re setting up which means a non-stop stream of energy and inspiration and re-arranging every time I look up. And we just finished a round of workshops for the first time ever, which means new friends and new work and fresh excitement. Our living room has fallen victim to my spontaneous 11pm idea to “just move that one end table real quick” and is now undergoing a major re-fresh involving light and airy paint colors, less clutter, and a more open furniture arrangement which has overall made our house 900x more wonderful to live in. We got rid of our TV – like, officially sold it – SO LONGGG friend! and in its place, sort of, I’m on a book-reading binge which is code for going to bed an hour earlier than usual.

    "description": "One of our most loved and favoured holiday dinner is a juicy roast turkey. With each Thanksgiving through the years, my mother learned the art of roasting turkey and became well-known for her succulent roasts. Many people brine their turkey for hours, sometimes days, or cook their turkey on roasting racks. We generally don’t do any of that, preferring to roast it belly down right at the beginning to keep those important juices recirculating through the meat. We create our own ‘roasting rack’ with garlic heads halved horizontally, so some of the flavoured pan juices cook right into the breast from the outside keeping it moist. The white meat roasts away from the heating element, preventing your turkey from drying out.After the success of our Garlic Herb Butter Roast Chicken, it was high time to share with you all our perfect roast turkey recipe.Roast Turkey in a roasting pan | cafedelites.com how to prepare a turkeyTurkey THAWING First, if you have a frozen turkey, you will need defrost it COMPLETELY in the refrigerator with the plastic packaging or bag intact. Place it in a large, deep roasting pan to prevent leaks running through your refrigerator shelves while it defrosts. Allow 24 hours for every 3–4 pounds (or 1.5-2 kg).In short, your turkey will need 2-3 days to completely defrost depending on the size of your bird.A quicker method for defrosting is to submerge the turkey in cold water (30 minutes per pound or 500g). Make sure your turkey is in a leak proof bag to submerge it in and change the water occasionally to keep it cool.It can take up to three hours to get the chill out of the turkey (depending on the size of the bird). Allow it to come close to room temperature before cooking so it roasts evenly.Once it has defrosted, pull out the neck and giblets (discard them or use them in soups or stews). Rinse the turkey inside and out and pluck out any stray feathers.Pat dry with paper towel before roasting.",

Don’t be afraid to use generous amounts!Rub the minced garlic over the chicken and under the skin. I do this separately as the last step to maximise the garlic taste.Stuff the garlic head into the chicken cavity along with the rosemary sprigs and the squeezed lemon halve. You can also use sprigs of Thyme or any other herb.Roast chicken, basting half way through cooking time, until cooked through.Broil until golden and crispy!",

    "description": "Here’s the thing – I do love chili. But here’s the other thing – I’m kind of picky about chili. I like chili that is:Thick! Mega thick.Chunky, but small, even chunks – no huge pieces of tomato, please.Spicy, but not like fire-in-your-mouth spicy. Just the cozy, warming, winter afternoon kind of spicy.Beany in moderation. I want to know that the beans are there, but not be thinking about beans with every bite.So… with that, I’d like to introduce you to my new favorite Sunday Chili. Ingredients for Sunday chili.What I Love About This Chili It’s thick and appropriately chunky, spicy and extremely flavorful without being hot, balanced just right between meat, beans, and vegetables, and excellently scoopable (what else is chili for, really). And not to mention it does that chili magic thing where it GETS BETTER AS LEFTOVERS.What Deliciousness Is Stewing In This?We have a really simple and delicious ingredient list for you.Ground beef Bacon Jalapeño, onion, and garlic Carrots (if you want) Spices Crushed tomatoes and tomato paste Beans Broth Let’s Get Cooking! We’re going to start by getting those bacon slices nice and crisped up. Very important step here – make an extra slice of bacon to crisp up and munch on while the rest of the chili cooks. This is essential. Now, save that bacon grease in the pan and plop your chopped veggies right in there. Your onions, your garlic, your carrots, your jalapeño – all of that goes in the pot.Next, add in your ground beef and spices. Ooooo! Things are smelling really good! Toss in the tomato paste, tomatoes, beans, broth, and crispy bacon bits (you know, the ones you have left at least after snacking). Cover the pot, turn the heat down to low, and go grab a magazine and a glass of wine. Or maybe more realistically in your household, unload the school backpacks, fold the laundry, and listen to the dog bark at a random squirrel in the yard because dinner is pretty much cooking itself at this point. Get your toppings together (maybe cilantro, probably avocado, definitely chips!) and let’s gooooo!",

    "description": "Key Ingredients for To bring this Crispy Baked Fish to life, you will need the following key ingredients:Cod: Although this recipe calls for cod, you can really use any kind of white fish. I recommend using fresh fish if possible, but you can also thaw out frozen fish if needed.Eggs: As with most breaded recipes, the eggs here serve as a binder. They help the breadcrumbs stick to the fish and maintain its texture while baking.All-purpose flour: Much like the eggs,the flour helps the breading stick to the fish so they get nice and crispy. For a gluten-free dish, simply swap out the flour for a gluten-free variety.Breadcrumbs: Breadcrumbs are what form the breading of these delicious baked fish pieces. I like to use seasoned breadcrumbs, but you can use plain ones and season them yourself if you like.Old Bay: When it comes to fish, there is no spice blend more perfect than Old Bay. In my opinion, at least. Old Bay contains celery seed, paprika, cayenne, dry mace, allspice, garlic powder, ginger, and pepper. You could also swap in seasoning salt, lemon pepper, or Cajun seasoning. Recipe Tips for Baked Breaded FishHere are some of my top tips to really make this dish shine:Switch up your fish. Although this recipe calls for cod, any white fish will work well here. Some of the best alternatives to cod include haddock, pollock, grouper, and striped bass.Use a cold batter and use it immediately. Cold batter sticks to the fish best, so try popping yours into the fridge for a few minutes before using it, if you have the time.When battering the fish, use the same spoon to transfer the fish from the eggs to the breadcrumb mixture. This will help ensure the batter sticks the way that we’re aiming for.Press the breadcrumbs into the fish, as this will give it a good stick. It will also help to flatten the fish out a bit, making it more similar to the consistency of regular fish and chips.If you have any excess batter, you can use it to make baked onion straws, baked pickles, or any other crispy baked delicacy that your heart desires.Don’t line your pan with foil. Instead, use a baking sheet on its own and preheat it until it’s hot. Then, add your fish and proceed as normal. This will help it get as crispy as possible. If you line the pan with anything, use parchment paper.Don’tovercrowd your pan! If the pieces of fish are touching or layered while cooking, they won’t crisp to the level that you want them to. Make sure they are evenly spaced on your baking pan for the best results.",

    "description": "how long do you cook cubed chicken?The recipe calls for 1-inch bite-sized pieces. For this reason, they only needy to be cooked in a hot pan for 5-6 minutes, or until they are browned all over and just cooked through! If your pan isn’t large enough, cook them in two batches to: Avoid overcrowding the pan Prevent boiling the chicken bites Get a nice, golden sear all over Once the rest of the ingredients have been cooked, those golden chicken bites get added back into the pan to warm through and continue cooking until its all done!",
